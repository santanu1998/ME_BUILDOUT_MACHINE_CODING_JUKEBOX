# Buildout Machine Coding Jukebox

## Overview

#### Everyone listens to songs on their favorite app ( Savvn, Wynk ) but have you ever thought about How you would make your music player? Design a music player with the features given below. 


* A user can create a playlist from an available pool of songs.

* A user can add songs to the playlist.

* Users can play the playlist and be able to switch songs (forward or backward)

* List all the songs in the pool.

### During this Micro-Experience, the developer:

* Set up a new Project with the required classes.

* Understand the application requirements and implement the problem statement from scratch.

* Tested the implementation with test cases to ensure correctness.
